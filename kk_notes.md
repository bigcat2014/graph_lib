optionals coerce to bools
unnecessary friend functions?
VertexHash struct why?
EdgeHash struct why?
Vertex\<T\> getCount() was interesting because I wasn't tracking static variable
declarations like that :)


I think I'm actually looking towards using `this->fn()` more, to 
immediately convey that fn is a method.
